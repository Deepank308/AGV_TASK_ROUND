This is the final submission folder for task 2.

There are two code files supplied:

1) edge_det.cpp --> Generates two images namely source image(original_image), sobel filtered image.

2) final_task_2.cpp --> This does the actual work. Takes in the sobel filtered image and and the original image as input and generates an Output.png image with lanes detected (only if I am that lucky :p).

**First run the edge_det.cpp file with image location as command-line arguement (Ex : $ ./edge_det Original_images/1.png)  and then the final_task_2.cpp file**

I have included the output I got for the input images.



Hope you like my effort =)

Thank You :)
